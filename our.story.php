    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Created by two friends in Reykjavík, Iceland, in 2013, Choco Land is led by passionate chef Prangate Alexandru and entrepreneur Bradac Mihai. Choco Land produces small-batch, “bean-to-bar” chocolate, using the finest cacao beans sourced worldwide. Together, Alexandru and Mihai challenge the understanding of bean-to-bar chocolate production, and the way flavors and textures can creatively expand the business.

     &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;As a chef, Alexandru has worked in Iceland, Luxembourg, Norway, and Sweden. Passionate about the culture behind food, his natural affinity for pastries and desserts led him to chocolate. He joined the bean-to-bar movement and began making chocolate from scratch, first producing single-origin bars and soon experimenting with flavors and textures achieved in small-scale batches. Joined by his childhood friend, Mihai, the duo quickly set up a modest production lab inside a converted gas station in Reykjavík, and Choco Land was born.

     &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Choco Land’s mission is to make the best chocolate possible using the highest-quality ingredients. Each one — single-origin cocoa beans from Madagascar, Tanzania, and Nicaragua; organic sugar cane; natural Icelandic milk powder — is individually sourced with care, placing ethics, sustainability, and transparency at the heart of the process. Sustainability starts with traceability: Choco Land buys ingredients by direct trade to further help assess the social, environmental, and economic impact of its purchases.

     &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Iceland’s unique ecosystem is rich in volcanic soil, marshes, ashes, and endemic plants that can be creatively crafted into ingredients. These Icelandic elements are a part of Choco Land’s DNA. Iceland is a place where anything is possible; Choco Land embraces this attitude.

     &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Choco Lnad’s aesthetic is uniquely both baroque and minimalist, inspired by fantastical creatures, surrealism, pop art, and contemporary Nordic architectural design. Its tattooed bestiary visually defines Choco Land. Unlike traditional chocolate bars, Choco Land’s chocolate doesn’t come in squares but rather in geometrical shards. Handmade in Iceland in small batches, Choco Land offers premium single-origin chocolate, Iceland-inspired bars, seasonal flavors, and Krunch, Choco Land’s chocolate-covered malt balls.
